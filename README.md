# Spring_Boot_JPA


NOTE

From a programming perspective, the ORM layer is an adapter layer: it adapts the language of object graphs to the language of SQL and relational tables. The ORM layer allows object-oriented developers to build software that persists data without ever leaving the object-oriented paradigm.
When you use JPA, you create a map from the datastore to your application's data model objects. Instead of defining how objects are saved and retrieved, 
you define the mapping between objects and your database, then invoke JPA to persist them. 
If you're using a relational database, much of the actual connection between your application code and the database will then be handled by JDBC, 
the Java Database Connectivity API.
